Have you ever wondered about sensitivity analysis of probabilistic systems? Have you ever thought about measuring sensitivity in terms of the derivative of, say, the expected reward? And are you curious to learn how to use these derivatives for making learning under uncertainty less data-hungry? Well, then we recommend reading our latest CAV paper {% cite BadingsCAV2023 -f papers %}.
