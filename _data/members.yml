    I am interested in various aspects of dependability and safety in AI, intelligent decision-making under uncertainty, and safe reinforcement learning.
    A key aspect of my research is a thorough understanding of the (epistemic or aleatoric) uncertainty that may occur when AI systems operate in the real world.
  interests:
    - artificial intelligence
    - planning under uncertainty
    - POMDPs
    - safe reinforcement learning
    - formal verification
