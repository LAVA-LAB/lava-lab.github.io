**Background:** Many modern problems, such as the optimisation of cellular networks, can be formulated as a multi-agent system with cost constraints. Using this formulation, we can use machine learning methods, such as multi-agent reinforcement learning, to find the optimal performance for the agents. Because of the rapid increase of complexity when many agents are involved, we often need to distribute the optimisation problem in a graphical structure that models (sparse) interactions between the agents. It is known how to decompose an unconstrained optimisation problem given a graph. However, it remains an open problem to efficiently formulate and optimise in a distributed manner while satisfying constraints.

**Project:** You will work on multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms, such as Monte Carlo tree search, under cost constraints. In particular, we are interested to find out if we can also decompose the optimisation objective using the graph given that we need to satisfy a maximum budget of expected costs. You can analyse the problem theoretically and/or play around with (existing) algorithms. Your supervisors can supply you with existing code to start working from.

Affinity with or the motivation to learn about Markov decision processes and reinforcement learning and/or Monte Carlo simulation is a big plus. Starting this project can easily lead you to a bachelor/master thesis, and possibly to a scientific publication. Please feel free to reach out to maris.galesloot@ru.nl for any questions.
