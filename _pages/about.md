AI-FM (Artificial Intelligence & Formal Methods) is a research group headed by <a href="https://nilsjansen.org/" target="_blank">Prof. Dr. Nils Jansen</a>, with members of both the Ruhr University Bochum and Radboud University Nijmegen.
We conduct broad foundational and application-driven research in artificial intelligence (AI), in particular neurosymbolic AI, which we combine with the area of formal methods (FM).
We tackle problems that are inspired by autonomous systems, industrial projects, and in particular planning problems in robotics.
