AI-FM (Artificial Intelligence & Formal Methods) is a research group headed by <a href="https://nilsjansen.org/" target="_blank">Prof. Dr. Nils Jansen</a>, with members of both the Ruhr University Bochum (RUB) and Radboud University Nijmegen.
Our group has a mission: 

**Increase the trustworthiness of Artificial Intelligence (AI)**

We conduct broad foundational and application-driven research. Our vision of neurosymbolic AI brings together the areas of machine learning and formal methods, in particular, formal verification. We tackle problems that are inspired by autonomous systems and planning problems in robotics.

The following goals are central to our efforts:
* Increase the dependability of AI in safety-critical environments.
* Render AI models robust against uncertain knowledge about their environment.
* Enhance the capabilities of formal verification to handle real-world problems using learning techniques.

We are interested in various aspects of dependability and safety in AI, intelligent decision-making under uncertainty, and safe reinforcement Learning. A key aspect of our research is a thorough understanding of the (epistemic or aleatoric) uncertainty that may occur when AI systems operate in the real world.
