The Lava-Lab, headed by <a href="https://nilsjansen.org/" target="_blank">Prof. Dr. Nils Jansen</a>, conducts broad foundational and application-driven research in artificial intelligence (AI), in particular neurosymbolic AI. We bring together the areas of machine learning and formal methods. We tackle problems that are inspired by autonomous systems, industrial projects, and in particular planning problems in robotics.
